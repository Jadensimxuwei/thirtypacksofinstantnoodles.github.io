						Our past
					</h2>
					<h3>
						Ever since our founder, JJ was born, he always loved the taste of boiling hot instant noodles. As the loving child he was, he wanted to share his noodle cooking expertise with people all around the world. Because of this, he started the culinary empire you are reading about today. Here are the last words the public has ever heard from him during his interview on BBC, also known as British Broadcasting Corporation: "I am JJ. As a child I yearned for warmth—not from blankets or bonfires, but from the steam rising off a pot of instant noodles, the kind that filled the tiny kitchen of our crumbling apartment with the scent of hope. We had little, but we always had those thirty packs, stacked like gold bricks in the cupboard, sustaining my mother, my sister, and me through winters both cold and cruel. Years later, with scars earned from hunger and ambition alike, I opened my own restaurant and named it not for glamour, but for truth: *Thirty Packs of Instant Noodles*. It’s not just a name—it’s a tribute, a rebellion, and a love letter to the food that fed my body and my dreams when the world offered nothing else."
